# Sunheart AI Verification System

This system provides objective verification of Sunheart AI's capabilities to prevent hallucination and ensure version numbers accurately reflect the implemented functionality.

## Purpose

1. **Objective Measurement**: Verify which capabilities actually exist in the codebase
2. **Version Accuracy**: Calculate appropriate version numbers based on verified capabilities 
3. **Prevent Hallucination**: Ensure claims about the system match reality
4. **Track Evolution**: Monitor system improvement over time

## How It Works

The verification system checks:

1. **Repository Structure**: Verifies core files and directories exist
2. **Component Functionality**: Tests if key components have required methods
3. **Evolution Status**: Confirms evolution threads are active and properly structured
4. **Module Implementation**: Validates that claimed modules actually exist with required features

## Running Verification



This will:
1. Verify all capabilities
2. Generate a version number based on verified components
3. Update VERSION.json in the repository
4. Create a verification report

## Versioning Rules

- **Major Version (0-3)**: Based on core components (Repository, AI Collaboration, Evolution)
- **Minor Version (0-n)**: Based on implemented modules (Clarity Engine, Expression Engine, etc.)
- **Patch Version (0-n)**: Improvements to existing components
