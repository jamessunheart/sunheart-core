# AI Collaboration System Integration

    

    ## Integration Components

    1. **Core AI Connector** - Connects the core execution engine to the AI collaboration system
    2. **Module AI Connector** - Enables modules to participate in AI collaboration
    3. **Protocol Harmonizer** - Standardizes communication between different AI systems
    4. **Self-Evolution System** - Guides autonomous improvement through evolution threads
    5. **AI Discovery Trails** - Helps AIs discover capabilities and resources

    ## How It Works

    1. The core execution engine registers its protocol with the harmonizer
    2. Modules register their protocols and capabilities
    3. The system evolves through self-improvement threads
    4. Discovery trails enable cross-system resource finding
    5. All components communicate through standardized protocols
